# xkcd-sveltekit

This very simple project was built with Sveltekit and Tailwind CSS for learning (and fun) purposes.

You can (and should, the comics are amazing) access the XKCD official website [here](https://xkcd.com/). The comics on this website are extracted from the [XKCD API](https://xkcd.com/json.html).
